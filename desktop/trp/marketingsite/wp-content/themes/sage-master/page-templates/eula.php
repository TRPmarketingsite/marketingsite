Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the License shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the License is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the License shall remain unaffected.
