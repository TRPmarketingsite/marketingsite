                <p>
                What Information Does Cooperative Collect?
                </p>
                <p>
                Cooperative collects two types of information from users of the Mobile Application and/or the Web Site: (1) non-personal information collected, for example, as you interact with our Mobile Application and/or Web Site that cannot be used to specifically identify or contact an individual ("Non-Personal Information"); and (2) personal information that can be used to specifically identify or contact an individual ("Personal Information").
                </p>
                <p>
                Users of the Mobile Application and/or the Web Site may also disclose Protected Health Information, as that term is defined in 45 C.F.R. 164.103, to Cooperative. The use and disclosure of such information is governed by the terms of a business associate agreement, [insert hyperlink], and is not subject to this policy.)
                </p>
                <p>
                Non-Personal Information
                </p>
                <p>
                When you use the Mobile Application and/or Web Site, our system automatically recognizes and collects certain Non-Personal Information about your use of the Mobile Application and/or Web Site, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) Address and domain name.
                </p>
                <p>
                Cooperative may also collect and use clickstream data, which includes a trail of electronic information left at each web site you visit. Such data tells us, for example, the type of computer and browsing software you are using and the address of the web site from which you linked to the Web Site. We may use this clickstream data to determine how much time visitors spend on each page of the Web Site, how visitors navigate throughout the Web Site, and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors.

                The above are only examples of the types of Personal Information we may collect.

                How Does Cooperative Aim to Protect My Information?
                </p>
                <p>
                The security of your Personal Information is important to us. For example, when you register as a member or use our Mobile Application, we endeavor to protect the security and integrity of any sensitive information collected thereon or therethrough by putting in place reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. However, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, due to the inherent open nature of the Internet we cannot guarantee that communications between you and the Mobile Application and/or Web Site, or information stored in the Mobile Application and/or Web Site or our servers, will be absolutely free from unauthorized access by third parties such as hackers. Your use of the Mobile Application and/or Web Site demonstrates your assumption of this risk.

                <p>
                You should be aware that any information and content, including Personal Information, and User Content (as hereinafter defined) you post to publicly accessible forums using the Mobile Application may be viewed and used by anyone with access to such forums.
